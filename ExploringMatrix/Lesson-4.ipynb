    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons we have been simulating data to study population dynamics of different species using the `Lotka-Volterra`.  In this particular lesson we are going to focus on using experimental data specifically bacteria co-culture data, to study bacteria relationships. We will use the data to identify model parameters and fit the model to the experinmental data. \n",
